## Introduction

The forgetting curve hypothesizes the decline of memory retention in time. 
This curve shows how information is lost over time when there is no attempt to retain it.

## Conceptual Framework
<!-- Establish the ontology or taxonomy of <xxx>, and the relationship with others. -->

> From 1880 to 1885, Hermann Ebbinghaus ran a limited, incomplete study on himself and published his hypothesis in 1885 as Über das Gedächtnis (later translated into English as Memory: A Contribution to Experimental Psychology). Ebbinghaus studied the memorisation of nonsense syllables, such as "WID" and "ZOF" (CVCs or Consonant–Vowel–Consonant) by repeatedly testing himself after various time periods and recording the results. He plotted these results on a graph creating what is now known as the "forgetting curve". Ebbinghaus investigated the rate of forgetting, but not the effect of spaced repetition on the increase in retrievability of memories.

An equation to approximate forgetting curve:

$$
b = \frac{100k}{(\log(t))^{c} + k}
$$

- $b$: saving expressed as a percentage, savings id defined as the relative amount of time saved on the second learning trial as a result of having had the first. A 75% saving would mean that relearning missed items required 25% as long as the original learning session.
- $t$: time in minutes, counting from one minute before end of learning.
- $c$: 1.25.
- $k$: 1.84.
