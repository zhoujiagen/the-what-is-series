## Introduction

**Feynman Technique** (coined after techniques used by physicist Richard Feynman) mental model allows one to learn by teaching someone else a topic in simple terms.

## Conceptual Framework

The technique uses four steps to obtain information and gauge the genuine understanding of the individual learning it. 

1. Choose a topic or idea that you want to gauge your comprehension on; it can be a topic that is completely new to you or something that you already know. Write down this topic in a notebook or on a piece, followed by everything you know about it and everything you are learning about it.

2. Write an explanation using simple language about the topic in the notebook as if you were teaching a class on it. 

3. Observe the gaps in your knowledge on the topic and return to studying about those specific gaps. 

4. Simplify your explanation in number 2. This can be done using analogies and simpler language.
